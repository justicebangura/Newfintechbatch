# Case Study Proposal: KOHO Financials, A free spending and saving app, changing how Canadians interact with their money and banking services.

## Overview and Origin

Koho Financial

Koho Financial is a Canadian Fintech company, It was founded in 2016 and launched in 2017 by Joshua Bixby, Jonathan Bixby, and Daniel Eberhard. KOHO financial service was created to replace your everyday saving, chequing, and credit card accounts. they are a "high-performing tech firm tracking to $1 billion in annual revenue with growth rates that match the top 1% of companies in the world". They offer an effective mobile banking tool that was created to challenge traditional banking systems. So far they have received 278.9 million in total funding over 10 rounds.

## Company Info and Activities:

Koho Financial solves the needs of many Canadians who desire a no-interest spending account that they can use for paying bills sending and receiving e-transfers, and receiving direct deposits and cheques. They currently have over five hundred thousand (500,000) customers and these numbers are expected to keep growing. their customer profile is based on the value of the commercial banking sector and I would estimate their potential customer market value to be "230.3 billion and growing at a steady 4 percent rate".

Some of Koho Financial services include the credit building facility which helps build the customer's credit ratings, lower foreign transaction fees compared to other competitors also "Increased cash back (2% on groceries, restaurants, and transportation), No FX fees when you spend aboard (savings of 2.50%), Price matching so you pay the lowest price on purchases, 1 free international ATM withdrawal each month and Access to financial coaching and priority support". "KOHO Financial uses 43 technology products and services including HTML5, jQuery, and Google Analytics, according to G2 Stack".

## Landscape:
Koho Financial is considered a personal finance, fintech company and they are part of the personal finance domain in the financial industry. some major trends and innovations in personal finance over the last 5-10 years include services such as Buy now, pay later (BNPL), Online banking and services such as KOHO, and the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and Robo financial advisors to the domain.

Other major companies in this domain include Mylo and ratehub.ca, "Koho Financial's top competitors include Neo Financial, Revolut, and Spring Financial. Neo Financial is a digital bank for Canadians that aims to provide financial services including cash-back rewards and savings".

## Impact:

Koho Financial over the years have helped customers improve their credit score, and earn cash-back reward points which they can spend towards buying groceries or fuel for their automobiles, this has been impactful not only in the lives of people but also their emergence improved the banking sector by making opening an account relatively easy, they have provided customers with a simple online personal banking platform. the company uses core metrics such as its customer base of over 500,000 people and also the amount raised from investors (278.9 million) to gauge its successes. compared to their competitors they also provide reliable financial services but require more ad spend so potential customers can know about them. 

## Recommendations:

I Would advise that Koho offers a personal finance robo advisor and budget supervisor, they can do this by installing a Robo-Advisor and budget API, this technology will help customers better understand their finances and navigate the financial world with ease.
